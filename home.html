    </header>

    <section>
        <p>In this era of globalization, institutions of higher learning cannot afford to confine themselves only to what is happening within the borders but must also focus on the developments in the international arena with an aim of remaining globally competitive.</p>

        <p>The University strives to integrate an international and intercultural dimension into its curriculum, research, and service functions, as these exchanges spur creativity and innovation. Internationalization activities have been aligned with the current DeKUT Strategic Plan 2023-2028. This plan acknowledges the numerous changes impacting the University, such as the growing student and staff population, an expanding research endeavor, evolving learning methods, increasing expectations from students, globalization, environmental awareness, and financial realities.</p>

        <p>The creation of an International Office aims to strengthen international activities at the University.</p>
